# hashlookup-server

PoC to better streamline the import of NSRL data.

Todo:

- Test with the other data sets (currently only Android was tested) : Fetch from ZIP and not ISO file
- Error handling (sufficient drive space, Redis active, check if there is already a db before init)
- Multiple data sets at once?
- Import from MISP (depends on filter)
